# Forecasting Demand in Healthcare Services

## **Project Overview**
This project aims to predict the future demand for healthcare services, such as hospital admissions, outpatient visits, emergency room visits, or specific treatment types. By leveraging historical data and machine learning techniques, this solution will assist healthcare providers in preparing for fluctuations in demand, optimizing resource allocation, and enhancing patient care.

## **Objective**
- Predict the number of healthcare services required in the future based on historical data.
- Utilize data features like previous admissions, seasonal trends, and demographic factors to build a reliable forecasting model.

## **Goal**
Enable hospitals and clinics to:
- Anticipate patient demand in advance.
- Plan resources such as staff, equipment, and space effectively.
- Reduce operational bottlenecks during peak periods.

## **Dataset**
### **Source**
- The dataset used in this project is a historical healthcare dataset located in a CSV file: `healthcare_dataset.csv`.

### **Features (Columns)**
1. **Time-Based Data**: Admissions over specific periods (daily, weekly, or monthly).
2. **Demographic Factors**: Age, gender, or population density.
3. **Service-Specific Data**: Emergency room visits, outpatient visits, or elective surgeries.
4. **External Variables**: Seasonal trends, holidays, or special events impacting demand.

## **Approach**
### **1. Data Exploration**
- Inspected the dataset using tools like `pandas` to understand data structure and identify missing values.
- Analyzed numerical and categorical variables using summary statistics (`describe()`, `info()`).

### **2. Data Preprocessing (Planned)**
- Handle missing data, outliers, and categorical encoding.
- Scale numeric features where necessary.

### **3. Forecasting Model**
- Train machine learning models like:
  - Time series forecasting models (e.g., ARIMA, SARIMA).
  - Regression-based models (e.g., Linear Regression, Random Forest).
- Use historical data trends to predict future healthcare demand.

### **4. Model Evaluation**
- Evaluate model performance using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and R-squared.

### **5. Visualization**
- Create visualizations to show:
  - Historical trends in healthcare demand.
  - Predicted demand vs. actual demand.
  - Seasonal patterns impacting service utilization.

## **Technical Stack**
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**:
  - Data Handling: `numpy`, `pandas`
  - Visualization: `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `plotly`
  - Machine Learning: Scikit-learn (and other ML libraries for advanced forecasting)
- **Tools**: Jupyter Notebook

## **Current Status**
### **What Has Been Done**
- Imported necessary libraries for analysis and modeling.
- Loaded and explored the dataset (`healthcare_dataset.csv`).
- Generated basic statistical insights into numerical and categorical data.

### **Next Steps**
1. Clean and preprocess the dataset to handle missing values, outliers, and feature encoding.
2. Explore time-series patterns for trends and seasonality.
3. Train forecasting models to predict future demand.
4. Evaluate the models and refine them for better accuracy.
5. Generate actionable insights for healthcare providers based on predictions.
